# pico-8-projects
Here you'll find all my pico-8 games I develop on my free time. Some are games, some are closer to poc. Feel free to try both of them.

# How to make it work
Two possibilities exist to play the games:
- you have pico-8 installed on your local device : just open the cartridge with it.
- you don't : use the bin folder to play it locally or html folder to use it with your browser.

# My itch.io profile
You should be able to find all you want related to my pico-8 production on **https://lumau29.itch.io**.
